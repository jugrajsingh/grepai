description: Install ready-to-use skills to help your AI agent master grepai
---

AI coding agents like Claude Code, Cursor, or Windsurf work better when they understand the tools at their disposal. **grepai-skills** is a collection of 27 skills that teach your AI agent how to use grepai effectively.

## What are Skills?

Skills are knowledge modules that AI agents can load to understand how to use specific tools. Instead of the agent guessing how to use grepai, skills provide:

- Step-by-step instructions for common workflows
- Best practices for writing effective search queries
- Troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Configuration examples for different use cases

## Installation

Install all 27 skills with a single command:

```bash
npx skills add yoanbernabeu/grepai-skills
```

This works with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, Windsurf, and 30+ other AI agents.

### Install specific skills

```bash
# Install only search-related skills
npx skills add yoanbernabeu/grepai-skills --skill grepai-search-basics

# Install globally (available in all projects)
npx skills add yoanbernabeu/grepai-skills -g

# List all available skills
npx skills add yoanbernabeu/grepai-skills --list

# Install to specific agents
npx skills add yoanbernabeu/grepai-skills -a claude-code -a cursor

# Non-interactive (CI/CD friendly)
npx skills add yoanbernabeu/grepai-skills --all -y
```

### Claude Code Plugin

```bash
/plugin marketplace add yoanbernabeu/grepai-skills
/plugin install grepai-complete@grepai-skills
```

### Manual installation

Copy the `skills/` directory from the repository to:
- **Global**: `~/.claude/skills/` (or `~/.cursor/skills/`, etc.)
- **Project**: `.claude/skills/` (or `.cursor/skills/`, etc.)

"Configure grepai to use OpenAI embeddings"
```

The agent will automatically use the relevant skills to provide accurate guidance.
